# Distracted-Driver-Detection
There has been a substantial increase in the total number of road accidents leading to fatal injuries and deaths in recent years. As per the Union Road Transport and Highways Ministry Report 2016, 17 people were killed each hour in India due to road accidents. A major reason behind these staggering figures are distracted drivers. In this paper, we aim to develop a model which will identify whether a driver is distracted or not. We will use various Deep Learning models, namely the Convolution Neural Network(CNN), VGG16 to create our model. For the purpose of training and testing, we have used the kaggle dataset provided by State Farm which contains images of drivers in different scenarios, and we will try to classify them into various classes. Some important libraries used in creation of this model are scikit-learn and keras.
